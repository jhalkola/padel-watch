# PadelWatch

### Idea
Idea for PadelWatch came from the need for reservation slots in the Padel venue in Vaasa.
Padel is quickly gaining popularity and it is common to have every evening timeslot reserved in the venue.
It became tiring to check different dates multiple times a day to see if there has been a cancellation and even then, you had to be fast to reserve the slot.
The solution was to create a software to do the checking and notify the user if a match has been cancelled.
